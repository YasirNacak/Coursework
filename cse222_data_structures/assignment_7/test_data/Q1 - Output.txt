	4 (weight:1)
	5 (weight:3)
	6 (weight:8)
	7 (weight:9)
	8 (weight:9)
	9 (weight:1)
	
adjacent vertices of 1:
	2 (weight:9)
	4 (weight:4)
	
adjacent vertices of 2:
	6 (weight:7)
	
adjacent vertices of 3:
	7 (weight:10)
	
adjacent vertices of 4:
	
adjacent vertices of 5:
	3 (weight:9)
	
adjacent vertices of 6:
	8 (weight:3)
	
adjacent vertices of 7:
	4 (weight:4)
	
adjacent vertices of 8:
	5 (weight:3)
	9 (weight:1)
	
adjacent vertices of 9:
	3 (weight:7)
	5 (weight:5)
